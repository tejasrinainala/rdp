- Take a curve composed of points
- Mark the start and end points of the curve 
- Find the distance between start point and end point
- Now,draw a line connecting start and end point directly
- Draw the line perpendicular to the previous line from each pont of the curve
- Find the farthest distance from all those perpendiculars 
- This divides the curve into parts and the same algorithm is applied 
- If the farthest point is greater than the epsilon point then consider it else discard it
- Now the algorithm recursively calls itself i.e, from the first to the farthest point and farthest to end point
- When the recursion is completed new curve is generated with fewer points.
